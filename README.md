# WritersConferenceWebsite

**Technologies Used**
-Javascript, HTML, CSS

## About the Project
This was a project for a web development CS course in which I had to design a conference website with a theme of my choosing.  While displaying proficiency in
CSS and HTML, I was also required to achieve a few things in Javascript.  These functions involved creating a voting system where local storage was used to tally
votes for nominees and display these vote counts in spans next to radio buttons.  There were also combinations both valid and invalid on the registration page in
which I had to use JS to maintain the valid combinations.  Invalid combinations would result in a pop-up window opening with a display of the errors committed.  
Finally, I had to create a function that would create a cookie based on the Conference ID that the user inputs into the registration form.  This conference ID 
will be set to the cookie in order for the user to populate the registration form when entering that ID number.
